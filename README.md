US Regional Sales & Profitability Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end business intelligence solution developed in Power BI. It analyzes transactional sales data for a fictional US-based company to uncover key insights into sales performance, profitability drivers, warehouse efficiency, and the impact of discount strategies.

Problem Statement
The primary objective was to transform raw, multi-file sales data into a dynamic, interactive dashboard. The goal is to provide stakeholders with a tool to answer critical business questions, such as:

What are the primary drivers of net sales and gross profit?

How do sales and profitability trend over time?

Which warehouses and sales channels are the top performers?

What is the relationship between discounts applied and overall profitability?
